Module 6 Challenge repository, WeatherPy

## Overview
After we finished with __PlanMyTrip__ app, a few changes were recommended so we can take the app to the next level, we should add a description of the weather, then allow the users to enter weather preferences (Min nd Max), then provide a list of potential destination matching with the selected weather range, also show route after selecting 4 cities.
